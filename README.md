<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product-Screenshot](images/output.jpg)

### Overview

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the "Pull Up" Advertising Campaign, a 360-degree marketing initiative carried out for a well-known brand of adult diapers in Iran. The campaign was executed by SISARV Marcom Agency. Our primary objective was to assess the campaign's effectiveness using a data-driven approach.
### Project Highlights
- ***Data-Driven Approach***: We approached this analysis using a data-driven methodology, leveraging statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to draw meaningful insights.

- ***Data Preprocessing***: We began by handling missing data and employing imputation techniques to ensure the data's integrity.

- ***Effectiveness Assessment***: We established a threshold and calculated the effectiveness of each paid advertising medium based on views. This allowed us to determine whether each medium provided value for our investment, helping us make informed decisions.

- ***Introducing 'Benefit' Category***: To encapsulate the concept of media effectiveness, we introduced a categorical feature called 'benefit.' This feature helps classify each medium as either delivering substantial benefits, cost overruns, or cost savings.

- ***Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis***: We conducted comprehensive descriptive and exploratory data analyses to gain insights into the dataset. This included visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis of the key features.

- ***Predictive Modeling***: We developed predictive models to forecast the benefit status of a new advertising medium. This involved extensive hyperparameter tuning and experimentation with various algorithms.

- ***Unsupervised Learning***: In addition to supervised learning, we explored an unsupervised learning approach using clustering techniques to uncover patterns within the data.
### Built With
